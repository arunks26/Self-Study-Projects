   - Table showing WPM, accuracy, errors, and elapsed time for each round.  
   - Summary statistics (mean, standard deviation, min, max) for WPM and accuracy.  
   - Interactive Plotly chart that visualizes WPM trends over multiple sessions.

3. **Beginner-Friendly Passages**  
   - Uses a CSV file (`short_stories.csv`) with short, beginner-friendly passages.
